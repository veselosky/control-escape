Choosing a Boot Loader
================================================================================
Every operating system provides a tiny program called a boot loader whose job
is to load the rest of the operating system into your computer's memory at
boot time. It is typical of the Linux personality that it gives you a choice
of boot loaders.

If you will be running Linux on a computer by itself, there is no need to read
any further, you want to use LILO as your boot loader. You can skip ahead to
the section about LILO. If you are planning for Linux to share your computer
with Windows, DOS, or another operating system, your choice will involve a
little more discrimination.

When setting up a multiple boot PC with Linux, you have three choices about
how to get it loaded: LILO, Loadlin, or floppy. Let's examine each separately.

LILO, the Linux Loader
********************************************************************************

Although opinions vary, LILO is certainly the most popular boot loader for
Linux. It resides on your hard drive, and at boot time it presents you with a
"boot prompt" where you can choose an operating system to boot, choose a
particular Linux kernel to load, and pass special parameters to the Linux
kernel when it is loaded. LILO is fast, flexible, and independent, since it
does not require any other operating system to be present. This makes it the
loader of choice for Linux-only systems.

LILO does have a few limitations, however, which means it is not perfect for
everyone. For starters, LILO can install itself in two places on your hard
drive: the *boot sector* of a partition (`what's a partition?
<lx-partition>`:doc:), or the *master boot record* of the hard drive. The
master boot record is the place on your hard drive that your computer's BIOS
looks for the *bootstrap* program that will load your operating system. This
can be LILO, or it can be the DOS (and Windows) boot loader. If there is no
other operating system present, LILO will have to be in the master boot
record. However, some operating systems, notably Windows NT, don't like for
the master boot record to be altered. Also, some disk utilities will see the
master boot record as "corrupted" and will kindly "fix" it for you, thus
erasing LILO and preventing you from booting Linux.

If you run into problems like this, you can install LILO into the boot sector
of the Linux partition, and allow the DOS boot loader to live in the master
boot record. In order to boot Linux, you will need to use the DOS version of
fdisk to set the Linux partition "active" and reboot your PC to get into
Linux. This is of course a big pain.

Another limitation of LILO is that it uses only your PC's BIOS to access your
hard drive. While this is not normally a problem, some new hard drives are so
big that the PC's BIOS may have difficulty reading it all. (This is due to a
limitation in the BIOS itself that goes back to the original IBM PC.) The
short explanation is that, due to this limitation, all of the files LILO needs
to access must reside within the first 1024 cylinders of your hard drive. For
a modern LBA BIOS, that means under the 8GB mark.

If you have an especially large hard drive and your other operating system
already takes up more space than this, you may need to jump through some hoops
to get LILO to work. You will either need to repartition your drive so that
Linux can have a partition within the first 1024 cylinders, or you will need
to install Linux (not LILO, but Linux) onto a second hard drive, again within
the first 1024 cylinders. LILO is capable of loading Linux from a second hard
drive with the same limitations.

+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Booting Linux with Loadlin
********************************************************************************

For those who cannot use LILO because of its limitations, or those who will
spend the majority of their time in Windows and very little using Linux,
Loadlin is an excellent alternative. Loadlin is a utility that runs under DOS.
It loads the Linux kernel into memory right on top of DOS. All of Loadlin's
files, including the Linux kernel itself, reside on your DOS partition. Like
LILO, Loadlin allows you to pass parameters to the Linux kernel at load time.
But because it uses the operating system driver rather than the BIOS to read
the hard drive, there is no 1024 cylinder limit as with LILO.

Of course, the main disadvantage of Loadlin is that you must boot to DOS
before you can load Linux. If you are running Windows 95/98, that means you
will have to reboot to MS-DOS mode, or make changes to the Windows
configuration so that it goes there by default. And whereas most Linux
distributions will install LILO for you, saving you the trouble of the initial
configuration, with Loadlin you are usually left to do it all on your own.

I find that Loadlin makes an excellent "backup" bootloader. Normally I use
LILO, but if LILO ever fails because some program clobbered my master boot
record, it is nice to be able to just load Linux from within DOS to repair the
damage rather than digging at the bottom of the closet trying to find that
boot floppy!

+===================================+======================================================+
| No 1024 cylinder limit.           | Requires DOS to load before Linux every time.        |

| of your hard drive.               |                                                      |

Booting Linux from Floppy Disk
********************************************************************************

Booting from floppy is the slowest but most reliable method, the least common
denominator for boot loaders. Loading the Linux kernel from floppy disk means
taking a couple of extra minutes to boot the system, but once it is loaded all
your normal Linux programs will run from the hard drive, so your system
performance will not suffer. The small size of the disk might limit the
capabilities of your Linux kernel, which can grow quite large if you like to
experiment, but most of the "stock" kernels shipping with current Linux
distributions will fit on a floppy without any trouble.

Of course floppies are easily lost or damaged, so you'd better have more than
one! On the other hand, there are no cylinder limitations on floppy disks, and
you don't have to worry about your master boot record at all. It's a good idea
to keep a boot floppy around for emergencies, but I would not use this method
regularly unless it is absolutely necessary.
