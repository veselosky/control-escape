Linux Installation, Step by Step
================================================================================
If you have come directly to this page hoping to install Linux without doing
any more reading, I suggest that you reconsider. Without the proper knowledge
and preparation, attempting to install any operating system (whether Linux or
any other) can be a disaster. So before I launch into the resources for your
step by step Linux installation, here are some things you should already have
read:

Each Linux installation has its own setup utility, every one vastly different
from all the others. This makes it very difficult if not impossible to write a
step by step Linux installation manual. The closest thing in existence is the
`Linux Installation and Getting Started Guide
<http://tldp.org/LDP/gs/gs.html>`_, which should be included in HTML format
with every Linux distribution, and is available online thanks to the `Linux
Documentation Project <http://tldp.org>`_. This book contains a fairly good
comparison of the major distributions and an outline of the installation
process for each one. It also covers the basic technical concepts you need to
understand during installation, and covers some issues of usability following
your install. I highly recommend that new users at least skim through this
book, and preferably absorb every word.

Also well worth the time it takes to read it is the `Linux Installation
HOW-TO <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/index.html>`_. This document
will give you some invaluable background knowledge about what is involved in
the installation process.

Now that you are armed with the knowledge you need, it is time to present you
with your map to Linux. Below are links to the official installation
documentation for the various Linux distributions. I had originally intended
to add my own reviews, comments and tips to this documentation, but with each
vendor releasing two new versions every year, I just can't keep up.

Ubuntu Linux
