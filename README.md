# Control-Escape

Control-Escape is an educational site that teaches you how to **own your platform**
by taking control of your technology and escaping vendor lock-in.

The current implementation is a hybrid architecture, with the bulk of the site
implemented as a static HTML site generated by Hugo, enhanced by a backing Django
project to handle any dynamic functions. This is an experimental architecture and may
change significantly over time.

## Developing and Deploying with Docker

Infrastructure is mostly managed in Docker using Docker Compose. This is a lightweight
application so its resource requirements are not heavy.

Local development stack is defined in the `compose-local.yaml`.

- Cache: redis (shared; 6379)
- Celery Broker: redis (shared; 6379)
- Celery result backend: redis (shared; 6379)
- Database: SQLite on a shared volume (mapped to ./var/db/)
- Email: mailpit (SMTP:1025; web:8025)
- Media: Shared volume mapped to ./var/media/
- Static: Shared volume mapped to ./var/static/

Improvements to make for production deployment:

- A container running LiteStream replication service for SQLite, also mounting the DB
  volume.
- A container running Caddy to terminate SSL, serve media/static files, and load balance
  across containers.

When we need them, we'll add containers to run celery workers and celery beat, and maybe
flower to monitor celery.
