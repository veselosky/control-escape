To prevent huge blocks of trailing whitespace in cards, we limit output to 4
lines, at which text will be truncated with an ellipsis. (This isn't much of a problem
at normal font sizes, but when users increase font size for accessibility, it can
become an issue.)

Height calculations for the P tags are based on number of lines of text
we want displayed (1em * line height for each line). We take advantage of the
CSS vars set by Bootstrap 5.2+.

As of 2025-10-25 line-clamp is not well supported, but curiously the -webkit- version
works in all major browsers (when paired with display: -webkit-box and
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;).  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
