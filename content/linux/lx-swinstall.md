One of the most difficult things to get used to in the Linux world is installing new
software packages. In the world of Windows, every program comes with a `Setup.exe`
program that asks you some very easy questions and takes care of the job for you. While
Linux software can be almost that easy to install, you will sometimes find software that
seems to fight every step of the way. I can\'t cover all the problems you might run
into, but I\'ll try to give you the basics and a few pointers to help get you over the
rough spots.

Software tends to come in \"packages\". In the Windows world a package is a `Setup.exe`
or a `program.zip` file. On a Mac a package is a `program.dmg` or a `program.sit` file.
In the Linux world, there are several kinds of packages, and each distribution has its
own preferred package format.

The standard Linux package format (according to the
[Linux Standard Base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base)) is `RPM`. RPM
is a packaging system originally developed by Red Hat and widely used in the Linux
community. Distributions using it include Fedora, Mandriva, Red Hat (naturally), and
SUSE. An RPM package file normally will be named something like
`program-version-other.rpm`

Another popular package format is `DEB`, the Debian software package. Debian packages
and the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) were the first to introduce several advanced
features that are now common, such as automatic dependency resolution and signed
packages. Debian packages are used by Debian GNU/Linux (naturally), and distributions
based on it, including Ubuntu, Knoppix, and Mepis. A Debian package file normally will
be named something like `program-version-other.deb`

Remember, you will need to [become
SuperUser]({{<ref "users-groups#becoming-superuser">}}) to install software.

## Debian, Ubuntu: APT

There is a broad array of tools for working with DEB packages, but the one you will
commonly use is `apt-get`, arguably the easiest of Linux package management tools.
`apt-get` is so easy because it not only keeps track of what packages are installed, but
also what other packages are available. It will even download them from the Internet for
you (if properly configured). :

    apt-get install ${packagename}

To remove software is just as easy. :

    apt-get remove ${packagename}

Although the repositories that contain installable packages might live on the Internet
or on a disc somewhere, APT keeps a local database on your hard drive with a list of all
available packages and where to find them. This database needs to be explicitly updated.
To update the APT database:

    apt-get update

A common idiom is to update your package database, and then upgrade all the packages
that have patches or security updates to install. The following command will do this all
at once. :

    apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

For a more indepth `apt-get` tutorial and other resources, see [Managing Software with
APT and dpkg]({{<ref "lx-swinstall-apt">}}).

## Fedora, Red Hat: `yum`

`yum` does for RPM packages roughly what `apt-get` does for Debian packages. Like
`apt-get`, `yum` can download and install packages from a configured repository. :

    yum install ${packagename}

To remove software is just as easy. :

    yum remove ${packagename}

`yum` does not keep a local copy of your package database by default, so normally there
is no need to update it. To install all available security patches and bug fixes, use
this command:

    yum update

You can also explicitly update a single package with:

    yum update ${packagename}

For a more indepth `yum` tutorial and other resources, see [Managing Software with yum
and rpm]({{<ref "lx-swinstall-yum">}}).

## Mandriva: `urpm`

Mandriva Linux (formerly Mandrake and Connectiva) has a toolset similar to APT called
`urpmi`. To install software:

    urpmi ${packagename}

To remove software:

    urpme ${packagename}

To update the local package database:

    urpmi.update -a

To install security updates and bug fixes:

    urpmi --auto-select

For a more indepth `yum` tutorial and other resources, see [Managing Software with
urpm]({{<ref "lx-swinstall-urpm">}}).

## Tar Balls

No, this is not a naughty term! A `tar ball` is a (usually compressed) archive of files,
similar to a Zip file on Windows or a Sit on the Mac. Tar balls come in files that end
in `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, or something along these lines. To unpack a tar ball, use
this command. :

    tar -xzvf ${filename}.tar.gz

The parameters are `x` to extract files, `z` to filter through gzip for decompression
(leave this off if the file does not have a `gz` extension), `v` for verbose mode so you
can tell what\'s going on, `f` indicating there will be a filename to follow. You may
want to create an alias called \"untar\" that feeds in these options if you have a hard
time remembering command line options as I do.

This command will not install the software, it will only extract the archived files. It
is your job then to find the README file or INSTALL file and read its instructions for
installation. If the archive contains binaries there will usually be a setup script
(often called `install.sh`) that you must execute as
[SuperUser]({{<ref "users-groups#becoming-superuser">}}).

Very often, software delivered in tar balls is not in executable form, but in source
code, which must first be compiled before it can be installed. For more details on this,
see [Installing Software from Source Code]({{<ref "lx-swinstall-tar">}}).

## Other Systems

Some other Linux distributions have their own way of managing packages, notably SUSE.
SUSE uses RPM as its native package format, but has its own high level tool to manage
system software installation.

SUSE Linux uses a tool called `yast` (which allegedly is an acronym for Yet Another
Setup Tool) to perform all kinds of system administration tasks, including installing
software. Having no experience with it, I cannot give you more details. `man yast` for
help.
