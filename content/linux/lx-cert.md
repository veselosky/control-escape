Linux is an operating system ideal for self-study, since the source code and
documentation are freely available. Sites like
[Control-Escape](http://www.control-escape.com) and the
[Linux Documentation Project](http://tldp.org) are here to help new users learn for
their own interests and at their own pace. However, many people find that they learn
better in a more structured environment, prefer a guided study (perhaps because they
don\'t have time to explore free-form), or want to further their career goals in
addition to gaining some knowledge. Here is a collection of resources that can get you
\"officially\" educated and even certified on Linux.

As Linux continues to invade corporate IT departments, certification will become more
and more important when looking for a job in the field. Most of the resources on this
page lean toward preparing for certification, but will also be useful for those who
merely wish to expand their own knowledge but prefer media other than the web.

## Certification and Training from Linux Vendors

If you are interested in a particular distribution of Linux, the best place to start is
with the Linux vendor. Most Linux distributors offer some level of training or
certification.

### Red Hat Certification

Red Hat offers a comprehensive certification program for their specific distribution of
Linux. Through partnerships Red hat offers numerous training and exam prep options,
including online courses and classroom training around the U.S. For details visit
[Red Hat Global Learning Services](http://www.redhat.com/training/).

Red Hat is the current market leader in the Linux world, and it also gives the only
exams that require hands-on, make-a-real-system-work testing. (The others are multiple
choice or fill in the blank type tests.) In my mind, this gives the Red Hat
Certification special value, but I do not know if employers agree. On the other hand,
Red Hat is by far the most expensive of the certification programs. I guess you get what
you pay for (?).

## Independent (Vendor-neutral) Certification Bodies

Since Linux is an open-source operating system provided by numerous vendors, there is no
\"official\" body to sanction certifications. Two vendor-neutral entities have risen to
the top as the primary authorities for Linux certification. I don\'t presently have any
direct experience with either of these organizations, so I am simply presenting
information. Judge for yourself.

### The Linux Professional Institute

The [LPI](http://www.lpi.org) is a non-profit corporation created by and within the
Linux community specifically for the purpose of creating a vendor-neutral certification
program for Linux. Many of the large Linux vendors have put their support behind this
program.
