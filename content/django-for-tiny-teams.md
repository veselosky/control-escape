There are lots of web frameworks and programming tools out there. If you are already an
expert at one of them, you can stop reading now: use what you know. But if you are
looking to start a side project indie-hacker style and aren't sure which framework to
use, use Django. Here's why.

- Django is built with Python, which is one of the easiest languages to pick up. That
  means the time from "starting" to "productive" is short.
- Django includes most of the tools you will need: URL routing, template system, form
  handling, an ORM providing access to multiple databases, database migrations to track
  changes to your database, RSS feed generator, sitemap generator, and more.
- Django has a vibrant ecosystem of "apps" or plugins to cover most needs that aren't
  included.
- Django apps are very straight-forward. Once you learn the patterns Django uses, you'll
  be knocking out features in no time flat.
