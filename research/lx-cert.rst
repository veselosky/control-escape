Linux Training and Certification
================================================================================

Linux is an operating system ideal for self-study, since the source code
and documentation are freely available. Sites like ***`Control-Escape <http://www.control-escape.com>`_***
and the `Linux Documentation Project <http://tldp.org>`_
are here to help new users learn for their own interests and at their own
pace. However, many people find that they learn better in a more structured
environment, prefer a guided study (perhaps because they don't have time
to explore free-form), or want to further their career goals in addition
to gaining some knowledge. Here is a collection of resources that can get
you "officially" educated and even certified on Linux.

As Linux continues to invade corporate IT departments,
certification will become more and more important when looking for a
job in the field. Most of the resources on this page lean toward
preparing for certification, but will also be useful for those who
merely wish to expand their own knowledge but prefer media other than
the web.

Training for Beginners
********************************************************************************

Linux Mandrake's Mandrake Campus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mandrake offers an impressive amount of online training material at
their `Mandrake
Campus <http://www.mandrakecampus.com/>`_. The material is oriented toward beginners, and teaches the
essentials of owning and operating your Linux system. You need to
register for the courses, but registration is completely free. The
login allows the system to track your progress as you complete courses
and take quizzes. Most of the material presented is vendor-neutral, so
the courses are of value to anyone getting started with Linux.

If you are a Linux novice and feel you are not quite ready for the big
guns yet, this is the perfect place to start. You should not pay money
for the other training courses until you know this material
thoroughly. Working through this free training will ensure that money
you spend later on advanced training will not be wasted.

Certification and Training from Linux Vendors
********************************************************************************

If you are interested in a particular distribution of Linux, the
best place to start is with the Linux vendor. Most Linux distributors
offer some level of training or certification.

Red Hat Certification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Red Hat offers a comprehensive certification program for their
specific distribution of Linux. Through partnerships Red hat offers
numerous training and exam prep options, including online courses and
classroom training around the U.S. For details visit `Red Hat Global
Learning Services <http://www.redhat.com/training/>`_.

Red Hat is the current market leader in the Linux world, and it
also gives the only exams that require hands-on,
make-a-real-system-work testing. (The others are multiple choice or
fill in the blank type tests.) In my mind, this gives the Red Hat
Certification special value, but I do not know if employers agree. On
the other hand, Red Hat is by far the most expensive of the
certification programs. I guess you get what you pay for (?).

Caldera
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Caldera offers a host of training products and services. They
support the LPI Certification (see below) for Linux, but they also
have training products for their other software offerings (notably SCO
Unix). For details visit `Caldera's OpenLearning Page <http://www.caldera.com/education/>`_.

Independent (Vendor-neutral) Certification Bodies
********************************************************************************

Since Linux is an open-source operating system provided by numerous
vendors, there is no "official" body to sanction certifications. Two
vendor-neutral entities have risen to the top as the primary
authorities for Linux certification. I don't presently have any direct
experience with either of these organizations, so I am simply
presenting information. Judge for yourself.

The Linux Professional Institute
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `LPI <http://www.lpi.org>`_ is a non-profit
corporation created by and within the Linux community specifically for
the purpose of creating a vendor-neutral certification program for
Linux. Many of the large Linux vendors have put their support behind
this program.

SAIR Linux and GNU Certification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAIR is a for-profit organization (like most certification
authorities). They boast impressive support among the Linux community
and claim that their tests and training material (see below under `Resources <#resources>`_) are far more
comprehensive than LPI's and other certification organizations. If you
are seeking a vendor-neutral certification, they are definitely worth
investigating.

Certification Resources
================================================================================

`Linux Certification Books </books/certbooks.html>`_
********************************************************************************

There are numerous books available that offer focused study to help the reader pass Linux Certification exams, and give an excellent review for system administrators who need to brush up on Linux. These books are collected in the `Book Shop Certification aisle </books/certbooks.html>`_, where you can view them by category.
